# Changelog

## 1.0.1

- Clear sent text and attachments immediately while Codex responds. Restore failed or stopped drafts without overwriting new work.
- Add Copy to sent messages, including saved chats, and make message text selectable.
- Render PDF page images even when Obsidian is in the background.
- Validate Codex responses, model settings, saved chats and PDF data. Run the source checks identified by Obsidian’s review in local lint and CI.
- Discover and launch Codex directly without a shell lookup. Keep the optional ZIP and checksums separate from the three Community release assets.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-11-04

First public release for Community submission. Replaces the earlier local-model development builds with Codex using an existing ChatGPT login.

- Image paste/upload/drop and selected-page PDF text or image attachments.
- Automatic vault tools and optional web search, without manual chat modes.

- Reviewed edit proposals, pre-edit recovery snapshots, freshness/YAML checks and guarded Undo.
- Saved chats with per-vault storage and bounded conversation replay.
- Backend shutdown after each reply with automatic continuation on the next message.
- Bundled Obsidian Markdown/Bases/Canvas skills and PDF/MathJax/image guidance.
- Phosphor bird, OWLA responder labels, accessible connection dot and responsive narrow-pane controls.
- Community installation support with skills and licence notices embedded in the three required files; searchable settings and explicit privacy/cost disclosures.
