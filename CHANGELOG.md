# Changelog

## 1.6.1

- Use Obsidian’s file manager for reviewed deletions and require a recoverable trash setting.
- Fix the PDF page action’s unnecessary `await` and the reported CSS compatibility and duplicate-declaration warnings.

## 1.6.0

- Optionally use Apple’s on-device model to choose a compatible Codex model and reasoning effort for each request. Show the chosen model and effort or the fallback in the sidebar.
- Require an explicit first connection in each vault, remember it across reloads, and show only Disconnect when connected.
- Show clickable change cards for reviewed notes, moves, deletions, and PDF annotations.
- Follow Obsidian’s new-note location for bare filenames and preview files or folders before moving them to Trash.
- Add native Markdown formatting and Mermaid guidance, including Obsidian’s colored highlights.

## 1.5.1

- Show PDFs and folders as single attachments. Read PDF pages, folder notes and converted document text on demand.
- Search PDF text by phrase and render scanned pages when requested.
- Bound image payloads and apply the Codex protocol size limit to individual messages.

## 1.5.0

- Review file and folder moves, renames and bulk organization before applying them with Obsidian’s internal link updates.
- Prewarm Codex while typing and show when OWLA’s Codex process is ready or resting.
- Show OWLA in the sidebar, collapse activity during replies, and place Copy Markdown beside Sources & activity.
- Confirm before starting a new chat, with an option to save recent messages.

## 1.4.0

- Attach whole PDFs without a page picker. Codex can fetch later page ranges automatically.
- Attach a folder or a selection of files from the File Explorer. Drag multiple vault or Finder files into chat.
- Draft new Markdown notes from chat and create them on acceptance.

## 1.3.0

- Accept arbitrary file drops and convert larger images and Office/iWork documents locally, with explicit preview or unsupported status.
- Read whole PDFs, resolve page wikilinks and add pages from the PDF viewer context menu.
- Review grouped PDF comments before accepting a separate annotated copy. Protect originals and reject stale sources.
- Choose editor highlights, no automatic diff or a normal split diff pane to the right of the note. Use muted colors without emoji markers.

## 1.2.2

- Prevent suggested edits from repeating the filename as a top Markdown heading when Obsidian shows the inline title.
- Preserve the top title during body edits if the inline title setting cannot be read.

## 1.2.1

- Apply each note’s suggested changes provisionally when the reply finishes.
- Accept or decline changes in chat and open the exact Markdown diff on demand.
- Lock the composer until all pending edits have a decision.
- Restore pending decisions on restart and protect newer note text when declining or undoing changes.

## 1.2.0

- Tighten Markdown spacing around headings, lists and quotes while keeping code indentation and wide blocks scrollable.
- Open vault links from replies in Obsidian and retain the source note path for relative links in new saved chats.
- Use Obsidian's sidebar background and divider colors, remove the current-note strip, and group completed activity with sources.
- Place copy icons inline and remove hover labels from the chat area and composer.

## 1.0.1

- Clear sent text and attachments immediately while Codex responds. Restore failed or stopped drafts without overwriting new work.
- Add Copy to sent messages, including saved chats, and make message text selectable.
- Render PDF page images even when Obsidian is in the background.
- Validate Codex responses, model settings, saved chats and PDF data. Run the source checks identified by Obsidian’s review in local lint and CI.
