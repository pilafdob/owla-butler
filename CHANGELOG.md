# Changelog

## 1.3.0

- Accept arbitrary file drops and convert larger images and Office/iWork documents locally, with explicit preview or unsupported status.
- Read whole PDFs, resolve page wikilinks and add pages from the PDF viewer context menu.
- Review grouped PDF comments before accepting a separate annotated copy. Protect originals and reject stale sources.
- Choose editor highlights, no automatic diff or a normal split diff pane to the right of the note. Use muted colors without emoji markers.

## 1.2.2

- Prevent suggested edits from repeating the filename as a top Markdown heading when Obsidian shows the inline title.
- Preserve the top title during body edits if the inline title setting cannot be read.

## 1.2.1

- Apply each note’s suggested changes provisionally when the reply finishes.
- Accept or decline changes in chat and open the exact Markdown diff on demand.
- Lock the composer until all pending edits have a decision.
- Restore pending decisions on restart and protect newer note text when declining or undoing changes.

## 1.2.0

- Tighten Markdown spacing around headings, lists and quotes while keeping code indentation and wide blocks scrollable.
- Open vault links from replies in Obsidian and retain the source note path for relative links in new saved chats.
- Use Obsidian's sidebar background and divider colors, remove the current-note strip, and group completed activity with sources.
- Place copy icons inline and remove hover labels from the chat area and composer.

## 1.0.1

- Clear sent text and attachments immediately while Codex responds. Restore failed or stopped drafts without overwriting new work.
- Add Copy to sent messages, including saved chats, and make message text selectable.
- Render PDF page images even when Obsidian is in the background.
- Validate Codex responses, model settings, saved chats and PDF data. Run the source checks identified by Obsidian’s review in local lint and CI.
- Discover and launch Codex directly without a shell lookup. Keep the optional ZIP and checksums separate from the three Community release assets.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-11-04

First public release for Community submission. Replaces the earlier local-model development builds with Codex using an existing ChatGPT login.

- Image paste/upload/drop and selected-page PDF text or image attachments.
- Automatic vault tools and optional web search, without manual chat modes.

- Reviewed edit proposals, pre-edit recovery snapshots, freshness/YAML checks and guarded Undo.
- Saved chats with per-vault storage and bounded conversation replay.
- Backend shutdown after each reply with automatic continuation on the next message.
- Bundled Obsidian Markdown/Bases/Canvas skills and PDF/MathJax/image guidance.
- Phosphor bird, OWLA responder labels, accessible connection dot and responsive narrow-pane controls.
