# Changelog

## 1.0.0 — 2026-11-04

First public release for Community submission. Replaces the earlier local-model development builds with Codex using an existing ChatGPT login.

- Native sidebar chat with current unsaved note context, selection capture, note attachments and source details.
- Image paste/upload/drop and selected-page PDF text or image attachments.
- Automatic vault tools and optional web search, without manual chat modes.
- Provider model/reasoning selection and actual Codex account usage windows in settings.
- Reviewed edit proposals, pre-edit recovery snapshots, freshness/YAML checks and guarded Undo.
- Saved chats with per-vault storage and bounded conversation replay.
- Backend shutdown after each reply with automatic continuation on the next message.
- Bundled Obsidian Markdown/Bases/Canvas skills and PDF/MathJax/image guidance.
- Phosphor bird, OWLA responder labels, accessible connection dot and responsive narrow-pane controls.
- Community installation support with skills and licence notices embedded in the three required files; searchable settings and explicit privacy/cost disclosures.

Requires macOS desktop Obsidian 1.14.5+, separately installed Codex CLI 0.162.1+, an eligible ChatGPT login and network access. No local model/runtime downloader, API-key authentication or automatic Codex installer is included. Existing development-build exclusions, storage and saved work are retained on migration.
